In-Class Activities - Class 5

ICA-5-1
----------
Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You are
given a file, say EmployeesSalary.txt, with the following data:

Miller Andrew 65789.87 5
Green Sheila 75892.56 6
Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1

Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name, current salary,
and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line, the last name of
the employee is Miller, the first name is Andrew, the current salary is
65789.87, and the pay increase is 5%. Write a program that reads data from
the specified file and stores the output in the file EmployeesUpdatedSalary.txt.  
For each employee, the data must be output in the following form: firstName
lastName updatedSalary. Format the output of decimal numbers to two
decimal places.
Save the file as EmployeesUpdatedSalary.java.  

ICA-5-2
----------
Write a program that calculates and prints the monthly paycheck for an
employee. The net pay is calculated after taking the following deductions:

	Federal Income Tax: 		15%
	State Tax: 					3.5%
	Social Security Tax: 		5.75%
	Medicare/Medicaid Tax:		2.75%
	Pension Plan: 				5%
	Health Insurance: 			$75.00

Your program should prompt the user to input the gross amount and the
employee name. 

For example:
Enter employee name: John Smith

John Smith
Enter gross amount: 3575.00

The output will be stored in a file (MonthlyPaycheck.txt). 
Format your output to have two decimal places. A sample output follows:

Bill Robinson
Gross Amount: 			$ 3575.00
Federal Tax: 			$ 536.25
State Tax: 				$ 125.13
Social Security Tax: 	$ 205.56
Medicare/Medicaid Tax: 	$ 98.31
Pension Plan: 			$ 178.75
Health Insurance: 		$ 75.00
Net Pay: 				$ 2356.00

Save the file as MonthlyPaycheck.java.  

Hint:
        federalTax = grossAmount * FEDERAL_TAX_RATE;
	  	stateTax = grossAmount * STATE_TAX_RATE;
	   	socialSecurityTax = grossAmount * SOCIAL_SECURITY_TAX_RATE;
	  	medicareMedicaidTax = grossAmount * MEDICARE_MEDICATE_TAX_RATE;
	  	pensionContribution = grossAmount * PENSION_PLAN_RATE;
	   	netPay = grossAmount - federalTax - stateTax
		       - socialSecurityTax - medicareMedicaidTax
			   - pensionContribution - HEALTH_INSURANECE;
